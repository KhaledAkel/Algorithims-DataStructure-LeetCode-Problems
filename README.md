  - **Problem 1**: Two Sum (Easy)
    - Difficulty: :star:
    - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
    - Files: `two_sum.py`, `two_sum.java`, `two_sum.cpp`
      - `two_sum.py`:
        - Summary: This code solves the Two Sum problem by using a dictionary/hashmap to store the complements of elements as we iterate through the array. It has a time complexity of O(n).
      - `two_sum.java`:
        - Summary: This code solves the Two Sum problem by using nested loops to compare every pair of elements in the array. It has a time complexity of O(n^2).
      - `two_sum.cpp`:
        - Summary: This code solves the Two Sum problem by sorting the array and using two pointers to find the pair that sums up to the target. It has a time complexity of O(n log n).
    
  - **Problem 2**: Container With Most Water (Medium)
    - Difficulty: :star::star:
    - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)
    - Files: `container_with_most_water.py`, `container_with_most_water.java`, `container_with_most_water.cpp`
      - `container_with_most_water.py`:
        - Summary: This code solves the Container With Most Water problem using a two-pointer approach. It starts with the widest container and moves the pointers inward based on the heights. It has a time complexity of O(n).
      - `container_with_most_water.java`:
        - Summary: This code solves the Container With Most Water problem by comparing every pair of heights using nested loops. It has a time complexity of O(n^2).
      - `container_with_most_water.cpp`:
        - Summary: This code solves the Container With Most Water problem using a two-pointer approach. It starts with the widest container and moves the pointers inward based on the heights. It has a time complexity of O(n).
